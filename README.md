# Welcome! 

Robots is a repository collecting some scripts where api and web scrapping are used. Most of these require specific keys for allowing to use the apis, so local configurations are required to be able to use them. Some of the api or scrapping methods might not work any longer since webpages might have been changed or removed. No maintenance is planned for these scripts.
